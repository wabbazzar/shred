# nSuns CAP3 (Cyclical AMRAP Progression - 3 Week) Program

## Program Overview
**Goal:** Strength and muscle building through cyclical AMRAP progression  
**Duration:** 3 weeks (repeatable cycle)  
**Frequency:** 6 days/week + 1 rest day  
**Style:** High-volume powerlifting with progressive overload and AMRAP sets

## Program Philosophy
The CAP3 program uses a 3-week cyclical approach where each week targets different rep ranges and intensities. The program emphasizes:
- **Progressive Overload:** Systematic weight increases across the 3-week cycle
- **AMRAP Sets:** "As Many Reps As Possible" to drive adaptation
- **Volume Progression:** Increasing total workload through the cycle
- **Movement Patterns:** Focus on the "big 3" powerlifts plus overhead pressing

## Training Maxes (TM) Setup
Before starting, establish your Training Maxes for each lift:
- **Squat Variations:** Low Bar Squat, Paused Squat
- **Bench Variations:** Flat Bench, Incline Bench  
- **Deadlift Variations:** Deadlift, Romanian Deadlift
- **Press Variations:** Push Press, Z Press
- **Row Variations:** Barbell Cheat Row, Strict Barbell Row

*Training Max = 90% of your current 1RM*

3. **Deload if Needed:**
   - If AMRAP reps decrease significantly
   - If you fail to complete prescribed reps
   - If excessive fatigue accumulates

---

## RECOVERY & NUTRITION

### Rest Periods:
- Main lifts: 3-5 minutes between sets
- AMRAP sets: 3-5 minutes before back-down work
- EMOM: As prescribed (rest = remainder of minute)
- Accessory work: 2-3 minutes

### Sleep & Recovery:
- Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep
- Prioritize sleep on heavy training days
- Consider naps on high-volume days

### Nutrition for Strength:
- Eat in a slight caloric surplus (200-500 calories/day)
- Prioritize protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Time carbs around workouts
- Stay well-hydrated throughout training

### Warm-up Protocol:
- Dynamic warm-up with band work
- Gradual load progression to working weight
- Mobility work on leg days
- Activation exercises as needed

---

## PROGRAM NOTES

**Volume Tracking:**
- Monitor total volume lifted per week
- Track AMRAP performance for progress indicators
- Use INOL (Intensity × Number of Lifts) for fatigue monitoring

**Autoregulation:**
- Adjust based on daily readiness
- Optional sets provide built-in autoregulation
- AMRAP sets allow for individual expression

**Customization:**
- Substitute exercises based on individual needs
- Adjust accessory work as needed
- Modify warm-up based on mobility requirements

**Safety Considerations:**
- Always use proper form over heavy weight
- Have a spotter for bench press work
- Use safety bars for squats when training alone
- Listen to your body and adjust intensity accordingly

---

*Remember: Consistency and progressive overload are key to success with CAP3. Focus on beating your previous AMRAP performances while maintaining excellent form throughout the 3-week cycle.*

Mobile-First PWA Development Rules for Shred Workout App:

1. MOBILE FIRST: Design for 320px-428px viewports first. Test on iPhone SE baseline. Desktop is enhancement only.
2. VISUAL VERIFICATION: Test every feature visually in browser, never trust console logs alone
3. OFFLINE FIRST: App must work 100% offline. Service worker and local storage are critical.
4. PERFORMANCE: Maintain 60 FPS on mobile. Touch response must be <50ms. Load time <3s on 3G.
5. TOUCH TARGETS: Minimum 44px for ALL interactive elements. No exceptions.
6. DARK THEME: Consistent dark UI with #121212 background, #FF6B00 orange accents, #00C851 green success
7. PWA FEATURES: Include manifest.json, service worker, offline capability, home screen installation
8. UNIFIED INPUT: Single methods handle all input types. No separate mobile/desktop code paths.
9. GIT WORKFLOW: Commit after each phase, before risks, when tests pass
10. DATA PERSISTENCE: All user data in local storage. CSV export/import for portability.

ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL CROSS-PLATFORM CONSISTENCY RULES:
- UNIFIED CODEBASE: One JavaScript codebase serves both mobile and desktop. NO platform-specific logic.
- RESPONSIVE ENHANCEMENT: Desktop CSS only adds enhancements via media queries. Core functionality identical.
- SIMULTANEOUS TESTING: Every bug fix MUST be tested on both mobile (< 768px) and desktop (>= 768px).
- DATA STRUCTURE CONSISTENCY: Same data manager, same methods, same API across all platforms.
- VISUAL PARITY: Desktop and mobile must show identical data, just with different styling.
- BUG FIX PROPAGATION: When fixing a bug, verify it's fixed on BOTH platforms before completing.

App-Specific Rules:
- Three-tab navigation (Day/Week/Calendar) with bottom placement for thumb access
- Collapsible sections remember state between sessions
- Exercise inputs have NO checkboxes - completion tracked by filled fields
- Swipe gestures for day/week navigation with 30px threshold
- Auto-suggestion from previous week's data as placeholders
- Completion colors: Gray (0%), Orange (1-99%), Green (100%)
- CSV format preserves complete workout history and structure
- Dark theme throughout with high contrast for outdoor visibility
- Program management allows multiple saved workout variations
- Settings accessible via top-right gear icon

Performance Requirements:
- 60 FPS during all animations and transitions
- Instant feedback for all touch interactions
- Smooth section expand/collapse (300ms ease)
- Tab transitions complete in 200ms
- No jank during swipe navigation
- Lazy load calendar view for performance

Testing Requirements:
- Test on real devices, not just emulators
- Verify offline functionality frequently
- Check touch targets with device inspector
- Test CSV export/import data integrity
- Validate all input types and ranges
- Test on slow 3G network speeds
- MANDATORY: Test every change on both mobile and desktop viewports
- Use tests/desktop_mobile_parity_test.html to verify consistency

Cross-Platform Development Workflow:
1. Implement feature in mobile-first approach
2. Test on mobile viewport (< 768px)
3. Add desktop enhancements via CSS media queries only
4. Test on desktop viewport (>= 768px)
5. Verify data consistency across both platforms
6. Test progressive auto-fill on both platforms
7. Commit only after both platforms work identically

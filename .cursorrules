Mobile-First PWA Development Rules for 6-Week Engagement Workout App:

1. MOBILE FIRST: Design for 320px-428px viewports first. Test on iPhone SE baseline. Desktop is enhancement only.
2. VISUAL VERIFICATION: Test every feature visually in browser, never trust console logs alone
3. OFFLINE FIRST: App must work 100% offline. Service worker and local storage are critical.
4. PERFORMANCE: Maintain 60 FPS on mobile. Touch response must be <50ms. Load time <3s on 3G.
5. TOUCH TARGETS: Minimum 44px for ALL interactive elements. No exceptions.
6. DARK THEME: Consistent dark UI with #121212 background, #FF6B00 orange accents, #00C851 green success
7. PWA FEATURES: Include manifest.json, service worker, offline capability, home screen installation
8. UNIFIED INPUT: Single methods handle all input types. No separate mobile/desktop code paths.
9. GIT WORKFLOW: Commit after each phase, before risks, when tests pass
10. DATA PERSISTENCE: All user data in local storage. CSV export/import for portability.

App-Specific Rules:
- Three-tab navigation (Day/Week/Calendar) with bottom placement for thumb access
- Collapsible sections remember state between sessions

- CSV format preserves complete workout history and structure
- Dark theme throughout with high contrast for outdoor visibility
- Program management allows multiple saved workout variations
- Settings accessible via top-right gear icon

Performance Requirements:
- 60 FPS during all animations and transitions
- Instant feedback for all touch interactions
- Smooth section expand/collapse (300ms ease)
- Tab transitions complete in 200ms
- No jank during swipe navigation
- Lazy load calendar view for performance

Testing Requirements:
- Test on real devices, not just emulators
- Verify offline functionality frequently
- Check touch targets with device inspector
- Test CSV export/import data integrity
- Validate all input types and ranges
- Test on slow 3G network speeds

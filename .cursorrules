Game Template Development Rules:

1. VISUAL VERIFICATION: Test every feature visually in browser, never trust console logs alone
2. MOBILE FIRST: Implement touch controls before keyboard/mouse. Test on 320px-428px viewports
3. PERFORMANCE: Maintain 60 FPS on mobile. Touch response must be <50ms
4. UNIFIED INPUT: Single methods handle touch/mouse/keyboard (no separate code paths)
5. GIT WORKFLOW: Commit after each phase, before risks, when tests pass
6. VISUAL POLISH: Every interaction needs visual feedback. Smooth animations mandatory
7. PWA FEATURES: Include manifest.json, service worker, offline capability
8. TOUCH TARGETS: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
9. GESTURE SUPPORT: Implement swipe/tap/long-press where appropriate
10. CACHE BUSTING: Include cache headers in every HTML file

Template-Specific Rules:
- This is a template repository - maintain generic structure
- Keep placeholder content for easy customization
- Include comprehensive test infrastructure
- Document all patterns for reuse across projects
- Maintain mobile-first architecture throughout
- Ensure all files are template-ready with clear customization points
